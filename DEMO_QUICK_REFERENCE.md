## 🎤 KEY PHRASES TO REMEMBER

**Hook**: "What if you could hunt ghosts in the real world, just like Pokémon Go?"

**Unique Selling Point**: "No single tool solves the case—you must combine overlapping clues like a detective."

**Skill Expression**: "The 7-second camera cooldown creates real tension—while your film develops, you're frantically switching between tools."

**Deduction**: "Each clue narrows it down, but the overlap points to the answer."

## ⚡ EMERGENCY BACKUP (30 seconds)

**"Ghost Hunt is an AR location-based ghost hunting game. You walk in the real world, use five analog tools to gather evidence, and solve mysteries by combining overlapping clues. The unique mechanic is a 7-second camera cooldown that forces rapid tool-switching, creating skill-based gameplay. Seven unique ghost types, each requiring multiple pieces of evidence to identify. It's Phasmophobia meets Pokémon Go."**
