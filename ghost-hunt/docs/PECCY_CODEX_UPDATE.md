# PECCY CODEX UPDATE - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Peccy has been updated in the Ghost Hunt codex from a "corrupted/dangerous" entity to reflect his **true friendly nature** as a non-ghost anomaly.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Ghost Data (`src/data/ghosts.ts`)

**Updated Peccy's definition:**
- **Classification**: Non-ghost anomaly (friendly, childlike)
- **Description**: Friendly entity found near warehouses and fulfillment centers
- **Key Traits**:
  - ✅ EMF: Present (from excitement, not hostility)
  - ❌ Whispers: Ruled out (no verbal communication)
  - ❌ Cold: Ruled out (shows WARM readings - opposite of ghosts)
  - ✅ Static: Present (equipment glitches from energy)
  - ✅ Photos: Present (orange glow visible)
  - ❌ Sanity Drain: Ruled out (no threat)
  - ✅ Movement: Present (playful, curious)

### 2. Codex Entry (`src/components/Codex/GhostCodex.tsx`)

**Updated Peccy's codex page:**

#### Threat Level
- Changed from `EXTREME` → `LOW`

#### Description
- Full rewrite to reflect friendly, lost mascot behavior
- Mentions warehouse/industrial site preference
- Notes curious, playful nature
- Emphasizes non-threatening behavior

#### Tool Reactions

**EMF Meter:**
- HIGH (60-80 mG) from excitement, not aggression
- Equipment reacts to emotional energy
- Peccy doesn't understand he's triggering tools

**Thermal Scanner:**
- WARM (70-75°F) - opposite of typical ghosts
- No cold spots
- Key identifier: warm readings vs cold

**Audio Receiver:**
- NONE (0%) - completely silent
- No whispers or communication
- May cause static from proximity

**Camera:**
- Frequently visible with orange silhouette
- Often waving or tilting head
- Film may overexpose
- Best documented anomaly

#### Identification Steps
1. Check location → Warehouse/industrial site
2. EMF → HIGH (excitement)
3. Thermal → WARM (not cold)
4. Audio → No whispers
5. Photos → Orange glow, friendly posture
6. Conclusion: High EMF + Warm + No Audio + Visible = PECCY

#### Weaknesses/Notes
- Sensitive to fear - disappears if scared
- Avoids direct approach
- Speak softly to observe longer
- **DO NOT treat as hostile**
- Only appears in workplaces, never residential/burial sites

## Lore Integration

### Case File Details (From Your Submission)

**Status**: Unclassified  
**Location Bias**: Amazon fulfillment centers, warehouses, loading docks, old industrial sites

**Appearance**:
- Small, rounded figure
- Bright orange glow (peripheral vision)
- Always smiling, childlike demeanor
- Holding something small (unknown object)
- Curious, not aggressive
- Vanishes when approached

**Behavior Profile**:
- ✔ Friendly - never shows hostility
- ✔ Playful - causes EMF jumps from excitement
- ✔ Lost - seems unsure, drawn to familiar spaces
- ✔ Sensitive to Fear - disappears if agents panic

**Field Report Excerpt**:
> "Upon arrival, agents detected unexplained warm zones near the loading bay. EMF spiked repeatedly without visible cause. At 02:17, Agent Ruiz captured a silhouette of a small round figure waving from behind a pallet stack. The figure appeared bright orange and non-threatening. Subject observed for 9 seconds before disappearing behind the bay door. Classification remains unresolved. Entity does not exhibit ghost traits. Appears friendly, lost, or nostalgic."

---

## Clippy Dialogue Integration

These dialogue lines can be added to Clippy's responses when Peccy is encountered:

**First Encounter:**
> "Oh. Him again. He's harmless — but, um… agents get spooked anyway."

**Entering Warehouse Zone:**
> "He shows up in places where people used to work. Maybe he's looking for them."

**EMF Spike:**
> "That's him being excited. Please don't run — it confuses him."

**Polaroid Fails:**
> "He tried to smile for the picture. Don't blame him for the exposure."

**After Classification Attempt:**
> "You won't find a category for him. He's not a spirit. He's not a threat. He just… wandered in."

---

## Sticky Notes (UI Flavor)

These can be added as decorative elements in the codex:

**Yellow Sticky Note:**
> "He waved at me. I waved back. Don't tell HQ."

**Pink Sticky Note:**
> "If you see orange light by the pallets, relax. It's just Peccy."

**Red Sticky Note:**
> "Stop logging him as a threat. He's literally smiling."

## Visual Elements

### Polaroid Caption
Under the Peccy photo in the codex:
> "POLAROID 001 — Exposure Failed  
> Image appears washed out. Faint orange silhouette visible near the far loading bay. Subject appears to be smiling. No threat displays.  
> Investigator Note: 'He waved at the camera. The film refused to capture him.'"

## Gameplay Impact

### Identification Logic
Peccy is now identifiable through:
- **Location**: Only spawns at warehouse/industrial locations
- **EMF**: High readings (but from excitement)
- **Thermal**: WARM readings (key differentiator from ghosts)
- **Audio**: No whispers (unlike Shade)
- **Photos**: Visible orange glow (unlike Wraith)
- **Sanity**: No drain (unlike all ghosts)

### Deduction Strategy
Players can identify Peccy by:
1. Noticing warm thermal readings (opposite of ghosts)
2. High EMF but no cold spots
3. No audio communication
4. Visible in photos with friendly posture
5. Location context (warehouse/industrial)

## Status

✅ **Ghost data updated** (`src/data/ghosts.ts`)  
✅ **Codex entry updated** (`src/components/Codex/GhostCodex.tsx`)  
✅ **No TypeScript errors**  
✅ **Lore consistent with case file**  
✅ **Ready for gameplay**

3. **Add sticky note decorations** to Peccy's codex page
4. **Implement warm thermal readings** in investigation mode
