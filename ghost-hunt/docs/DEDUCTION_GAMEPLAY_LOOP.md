# Deduction Gameplay Loop - Skill-Based Problem Solving

## 🎯 Purpose

This document describes the **complete gameplay loop** for identifying ghosts using the balanced overlap system. Every ghost requires **2-3 pieces of evidence minimum** to identify, creating skill-based problem-solving gameplay.

---

## 🔄 Core Deduction Loop (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Enter the Hotspot
- Sanity begins ticking down slowly
- Ghost is static at a location (MVP)
- Player must physically walk to find it

---

### 2. Radar First → Find the Direction
- Radar blip wiggles ±5° so player must rotate phone IRL
- **Radar gives zero deduction, just direction**
- Player notes the heading (e.g., "Ghost is at 45°")

---

### 3. EMF Second → Confirm Distance + Observe Personality
- EMF = true distance (0-5) **PLUS** personality noise
- Player walks physically toward the ghost
- **Skill Required**: Player must observe the **pattern**, not just the level

#### EMF Pattern Recognition:
- **AGGRESSIVE**: Spikes early at distance (Banshee) OR spikes when moving fast close-up (Wraith)
  - **Skill**: Observe WHEN spike happens → early = Banshee, close = Wraith
- **UNSTABLE**: Random jitter (Poltergeist) OR sine wave oscillation (Trickster)
  - **Skill**: Observe PATTERN → random = Poltergeist, sine wave = Trickster
- **SHY**: Reads low until very close (Shade, Onyx)
  - **Skill**: Both similar, need other traits to distinguish
- **CALM**: Consistent, smooth readings (Phantom, Wraith)
  - **Skill**: Need other traits to distinguish

**Result**: EMF narrows to **2 ghosts** (never 1)

**Example**: Player sees "UNSTABLE pattern - random jitter"
- **Narrows to**: Poltergeist OR Trickster (2 ghosts)
- **Player notes**: "EMF: Unstable (random jitter)"

---

### 4. When EMF Peaks (4/5) → Take a Photo
- Camera locks for **7 seconds** (film developing)
- This is the **intentional pacing mechanic**
- Player must wait, creating tension

---

### 5. While Camera is in Cooldown (7s Window) - **SKILL EXPRESSION**

Player rapidly rotates through tools to gather evidence:

#### 5a. EMF → Double-Check Personality Pattern
- **Time**: 1-2 seconds
- **Action**: Observe pattern over time
- **Note**: "Random jitter" or "Sine wave" or "Spikes early"
- **Result**: Confirms EMF personality type

#### 5b. Spirit Box → Tune Knobs, Get Words
- **Time**: 2-3 seconds (if quick tuning)
- **Action**: 
  - Adjust Knob A and Knob B
  - Get within tolerance → Signal locks
  - Ghost whispers a word
- **Skill**: Fast, precise tuning
- **Note**: Word from ghost (e.g., "chaotic", "playful", "behind")
- **Result**: Word narrows to 2-3 ghosts (overlaps)

**Example**: Player tunes quickly, gets word "chaotic"
- **Narrows to**: Poltergeist OR Trickster (2 ghosts)
- **Player notes**: "Spirit Box: 'chaotic'"

#### 5c. Thermal → Check Temperature Pattern
- **Time**: 1 second
- **Action**: Quick scan for cold spots
- **Skill**: Observe BEHAVIOR, not just reading
  - Stable cold spot?
  - Moving cold spot?
  - Appearing/disappearing?
- **Note**: "Cold Spot (stable)" or "Deep Cold (ground source)"
- **Result**: Thermal narrows to 2-3 ghosts

**Example**: Player sees "Cold Spot (appears/disappears randomly)"
- **Narrows to**: Poltergeist (random cold spots)
- **Player notes**: "Thermal: Cold Spot (unstable)"

#### 5d. Radar → Verify Direction (Optional)
- **Time**: 0.5 seconds
- **Action**: Quick check if ghost moved
- **Result**: No deduction, just navigation

**Total Time**: ~5-7 seconds ✅ **Perfect fit for camera cooldown!**

---

### 6. After Film Develops → Check Photo
- Player checks the photo manifestation:
  - **FAINT_SILHOUETTE** → Wraith OR Shade
  - **MOTION_BLUR** → Poltergeist OR Trickster
  - **SCREAMING_FACE** → Banshee OR Poltergeist
  - **INVISIBLE** → Phantom OR Shade
  - **SHADOW_SILHOUETTE** → Onyx OR Shade
  - **GLITCH_STREAKS** → Trickster OR Poltergeist
  - **DEEP_SHADOW** → Banshee OR Onyx
  - **HALF_FORMED_BODY** → Shade OR Onyx

**Skill Required**: 
- Each ghost has 2 possible manifestations with different probabilities
- Player might need **multiple photos** to see both types
- Example: Banshee shows SCREAMING_FACE (85%) or DEEP_SHADOW (15%)
  - If player only sees DEEP_SHADOW, might think it's Onyx
  - Need multiple photos to be sure

**Example**: Player sees "MOTION_BLUR"
- **Narrows to**: Poltergeist OR Trickster (2 ghosts)
- **Player notes**: "Camera: Motion Blur"

---

### 7. Gather Enough Combined Hints → Open Evidence Tab

Player opens the **Evidence Tab** (Phasmophobia-style checklist):

#### Evidence Tab Features:
- **EMF Personality Dropdown**: Select specific personality (Calm, Unstable, Shy, Aggressive)
- **Spirit Box Words Checkbox**: Present / Ruled Out / Unknown
- **Thermal Reading Dropdown**: Select specific reading (Normal, Cold Spot, Deep Cold)
- **Camera Manifestation Dropdown**: Select specific type (9 options)

#### Player Fills Out Evidence:
1. **EMF Personality**: Select "Unstable"
2. **Whispers**: Check "Present"
3. **Thermal Reading**: Select "Cold Spot"
4. **Camera Manifestation**: Select "Motion Blur"

#### Possible Ghosts Section Updates:
- Shows ghosts that match current evidence
- **Narrows down in real-time** as player selects evidence

---

### 8. Deduction Process - **SKILL-BASED PROBLEM SOLVING**

#### Example Case: Identifying Poltergeist

**Step 1**: Player observes EMF
- **Observation**: "Random jitter pattern, unstable"
- **Evidence Tab**: Select "Unstable" EMF
- **Possible Ghosts**: Poltergeist, Trickster (2 ghosts)

**Step 2**: Player tunes Spirit Box
- **Observation**: Gets word "chaotic"
- **Evidence Tab**: Check "Present" for Whispers
- **Possible Ghosts**: Still Poltergeist, Trickster (both have whispers)

**Step 3**: Player takes photo
- **Observation**: "Motion Blur"
- **Evidence Tab**: Select "Motion Blur" camera manifestation
- **Possible Ghosts**: Still Poltergeist, Trickster (both show motion blur)

**Step 4**: Player checks Thermal
- **Observation**: "Cold Spot appears/disappears randomly"
- **Evidence Tab**: Select "Cold Spot" thermal reading
- **Possible Ghosts**: Still Poltergeist, Trickster (both have cold spots)

**Step 5**: **CRITICAL SKILL MOMENT** - Pattern Recognition
- Player must remember: **Poltergeist has RULED_OUT whispers, Trickster has PRESENT whispers**
- Player checks Spirit Box again: Gets word "chaotic"
- **Wait!** Player realizes: Poltergeist words are "noisy, chaotic, mine" - but Poltergeist has RULED_OUT whispers in definition
- **Actually**: Player needs to check if Spirit Box is working at all

**Step 6**: **REALIZATION** - Check Whispers Status
- Player tries Spirit Box again: Can't get signal lock easily
- **Observation**: "Spirit Box is hard to tune, minimal communication"
- **Evidence Tab**: Change Whispers to "RULED_OUT"
- **Possible Ghosts**: **Poltergeist** (Trickster has PRESENT whispers) ✅

**Result**: **Poltergeist identified with 4 pieces of evidence!**

---

#### Example Case: Identifying Banshee

**Step 1**: Player observes EMF
- **Observation**: "EMF spikes early, even at distance"
- **Evidence Tab**: Select "Aggressive" EMF
- **Possible Ghosts**: Banshee, Wraith (2 ghosts)

**Step 2**: Player tunes Spirit Box
- **Observation**: Gets word "anger"
- **Evidence Tab**: Check "Present" for Whispers
- **Possible Ghosts**: **Banshee** (Wraith has RULED_OUT whispers) ✅

**Result**: **Banshee identified with 2 pieces of evidence!**

---

#### Example Case: Identifying Phantom

**Step 1**: Player observes EMF
- **Observation**: "Consistent, smooth readings"
- **Evidence Tab**: Select "Calm" EMF
- **Possible Ghosts**: Wraith, Phantom (2 ghosts)

**Step 2**: Player checks Thermal
- **Observation**: "Extreme cold, below 8°C"
- **Evidence Tab**: Select "Deep Cold" thermal reading
- **Possible Ghosts**: Phantom, Onyx (2 ghosts)

**Step 3**: Player takes photo
- **Observation**: "Photo is blank - invisible!"
- **Evidence Tab**: Select "Invisible" camera manifestation
- **Possible Ghosts**: Phantom, Shade (2 ghosts)

**Step 4**: **CRITICAL SKILL MOMENT** - Combine Evidence
- Player has: Calm EMF + Deep Cold + Invisible
- **Calm EMF** → Wraith, Phantom
- **Deep Cold** → Phantom, Onyx
- **Invisible** → Phantom, Shade
- **Overlap**: **Phantom** appears in all three! ✅

**Result**: **Phantom identified with 3 pieces of evidence!**

---

#### Example Case: Identifying Trickster (The Contradiction Ghost)

**Step 1**: Player observes EMF
- **Observation**: "AGGRESSIVE pattern - spikes early"
- **Evidence Tab**: Select "Aggressive" EMF
- **Possible Ghosts**: Banshee, Wraith (2 ghosts)

**Step 2**: Player tunes Spirit Box
- **Observation**: Gets word "chaotic" but... can't get signal lock easily
- **Evidence Tab**: Check "Ruled Out" for Whispers
- **Possible Ghosts**: Wraith (Banshee has PRESENT whispers)

**Step 3**: Player checks Thermal
- **Observation**: "DEEP_COLD - extreme cold!"
- **Evidence Tab**: Select "Deep Cold" thermal reading
- **Possible Ghosts**: **0 matches!** ⚠️
- **Player thinks**: "Wait... Wraith has NORMAL thermal, not DEEP_COLD!"

**Step 4**: Player takes photo
- **Observation**: "SCREAMING_FACE - terrifying!"
- **Evidence Tab**: Select "Screaming Face" camera manifestation
- **Possible Ghosts**: Still **0 matches!**
- **Player realizes**: "SCREAMING_FACE is Banshee's trait, but I have RULED_OUT whispers and DEEP_COLD... this doesn't match ANY ghost!"

**Step 5**: **CRITICAL SKILL MOMENT** - Recognize Contradiction
- Player reviews evidence:
  - AGGRESSIVE EMF → Banshee or Wraith
  - RULED_OUT Whispers → Wraith (Banshee has PRESENT)
  - DEEP_COLD Thermal → Phantom or Onyx (Wraith has NORMAL)
  - SCREAMING_FACE Camera → Banshee (Wraith has FAINT_SILHOUETTE)
- **Realization**: "This combination is IMPOSSIBLE for any ghost! It must be Trickster - the one that shows contradictory traits!"

**Result**: **Trickster identified by recognizing contradiction!**
**Skill Required**: Knowledge of all ghost definitions + logical deduction

## 🎯 Minimum Evidence Required

**Every ghost requires 2-3 traits minimum to identify uniquely:**

- **Banshee**: AGGRESSIVE EMF + PRESENT Whispers (2 traits)
- **Phantom**: DEEP_COLD Thermal + CALM EMF (2 traits) OR DEEP_COLD + INVISIBLE (2 traits)
- **Trickster**: **0 matches = Trickster!** - **requires recognizing contradiction**
- **Wraith**: AGGRESSIVE EMF + RULED_OUT Whispers (2 traits)
- **Poltergeist**: UNSTABLE EMF (jitter) + RULED_OUT Whispers (2 traits) - **requires pattern recognition skill**
