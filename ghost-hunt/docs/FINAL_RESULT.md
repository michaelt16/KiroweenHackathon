## 💡 Key Differences

### From "Good" to "AAA"

**Good Horror**:
- Clean damage
- Aligned elements
- Single shadows
- Perfect tape placement

**AAA Horror**:
- Authentic chaos
- Nothing aligned
- Layered depth
- Misaligned tape
- Overlapping cards
- Rougher edges
- More grime
- Natural imperfection

---

## 🔥 The Secret Sauce

1. **Nothing is perfect** - Every element slightly off
2. **Layered shadows** - Creates depth and realism
3. **Darker edges** - Water damage vignette
4. **Rougher borders** - Dashed instead of solid
5. **Overlap** - Cards feel stacked, not grid
6. **Misalignment** - Tape, text, everything
7. **Heavy ink bleed** - Red text bleeds into paper
8. **3D perspective** - Polaroid lifts off page
9. **More damage** - Tears, burns, scratches
10. **Chaos** - Random rotations, not uniform
