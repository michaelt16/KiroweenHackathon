## 🎬 FULL SCRIPT

### [0:00-0:10] HOOK
**"What if you could hunt ghosts in the real world, just like Pokémon Go?"**

**"Ghost Hunt is an AR location-based game that turns your neighborhood into a paranormal investigation zone. You physically walk around, collect ghost-hunting tools, and solve supernatural mysteries using real-world exploration."**

---

### [0:10-0:25] CORE CONCEPT
**"Here's how it works: You explore the map, find haunted hotspots, and enter Investigation Mode. Once inside, you use five analog tools—Radar, EMF, Camera, Spirit Box, and Thermal—to gather evidence about the ghost's identity."**

**"The twist? No single tool solves the case. You must combine overlapping clues—like a detective—to identify which of seven unique ghost types you're dealing with."**

---

### [0:25-0:40] KEY FEATURES
**"Each tool reveals different information: Radar points you in the right direction, EMF shows distance plus personality patterns, the Camera captures manifestations with a 7-second film development delay, the Spirit Box requires dual-knob tuning to hear ghost whispers, and Thermal detects temperature anomalies."**

**"The 7-second camera cooldown creates real tension—while your film develops, you're frantically switching between tools, trying to gather more evidence before your sanity runs out."**

---

### [0:40-0:55] UNIQUE SELLING POINT
**"What makes this special is the deduction system. Each ghost has overlapping traits—so 'aggressive EMF' might match two ghosts, 'cold spot' might match three. You need to combine multiple pieces of evidence to solve the mystery."**

**"It's skill-based problem-solving, not just collecting clues. And with seven unique ghost personalities—from the calm Wraith to the mischievous Trickster—every investigation feels different."**

---

### [0:55-1:15] LIVE DEMO - Map View
**[SHOW MAP SCREEN]**
**"Let me show you. Here's the world map—you can see tool spawn nodes and haunted hotspots. When you walk close to a hotspot..."**

**[TAP HOTSPOT → ENTER INVESTIGATION MODE]**

---

### [1:15-1:35] LIVE DEMO - Investigation
**[SHOW INVESTIGATION MODE]**
**"Investigation Mode activates. Your sanity starts ticking down. First, I use the Radar to find the ghost's direction—see how the blip wiggles? I need to rotate my phone physically."**

**[SWITCH TO EMF]**
**"Now the EMF meter—it shows distance plus personality noise. I'm walking closer... see how it spikes? That's the ghost's personality showing through."**

**[SWITCH TO CAMERA, TAKE PHOTO]**
**"When I'm close enough, I take a photo. But there's a 7-second development delay—this is where the skill comes in. While waiting, I'm switching tools..."**

**[RAPIDLY SWITCH: SPIRIT BOX → THERMAL → BACK TO EMF]**
**"...tuning the Spirit Box, checking thermal readings, re-verifying EMF patterns. This tool-juggling window is where players really express skill."**

---

### [1:35-1:50] EVIDENCE & DEDUCTION
**[SHOW EVIDENCE TAB]**
**"After gathering enough evidence, I open the Evidence Tab. See how each clue narrows it down? Camera shows 'motion blur'—that's two ghosts. EMF shows 'unstable'—that's two more. But the overlap..."**

**[SELECT GHOST]**
**"...points to Poltergeist. The deduction system ensures you need multiple pieces of evidence—no single tool gives you the answer."**

---

### [1:50-2:00] CLOSING
**"Ghost Hunt combines real-world exploration with skill-based deduction gameplay. It's built with React, Vite, and Leaflet, and it's ready to turn any location into a paranormal investigation zone."**

**"Thank you!"**

## 📝 PRESENTATION TIPS

1. **Practice the tool switching** - The rapid tool rotation during camera cooldown should look smooth
2. **Emphasize the "overlap" concept** - This is what makes it unique
3. **Show physical phone rotation** - The Radar mechanic requires real movement
4. **Have a backup plan** - If demo fails, describe the gameplay loop clearly
5. **End with energy** - The closing should feel confident and exciting

---

## 🚨 BACKUP PLAN (If Demo Crashes)

**"Ghost Hunt is an AR ghost-hunting game where you:**
1. **Explore** - Walk in the real world to find tools and hotspots
2. **Investigate** - Use five tools (Radar, EMF, Camera, Spirit Box, Thermal) to gather evidence
3. **Deduce** - Combine overlapping clues to identify one of seven ghost types
4. **The unique mechanic** - No single tool solves it; you need skill-based deduction

**The 7-second camera cooldown forces you to rapidly switch tools, creating real tension and skill expression. It's like Phasmophobia meets Pokémon Go."**
