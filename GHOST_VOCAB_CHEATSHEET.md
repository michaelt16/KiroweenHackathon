# 👻 Ghost Hunt - Spirit Box Quick Reference

## Investigation Mode Spirit Box Guide

This guide helps you identify ghosts based on Spirit Box responses during investigations.

## 🎯 HOW THE SPIRIT BOX WORKS

### Three Questions You Can Ask:
1. **"What do you want?"** - Intent/Motivation words
2. **"Where are you?"** - Location/Presence words  
3. **"Are you here?"** - Confirmation/Proximity words

### Response System:
- **Common Words (30-40%)**: Shared by all ghosts - not very helpful
- **Personality Words (45-55%)**: Specific to ghost personality type - key for identification
- **Unique Words (15%)**: Ghost-specific signature words - strongest clue!

### Ghost Personalities:
- **Aggressive** (Wraith, Onyx): 75% response rate - threatening, direct
- **Shy** (Banshee, Shade): 35% response rate - evasive, quiet
- **Chaotic** (Poltergeist, Phantom): 55% response rate - playful, unpredictable
- **Contradictory** (Trickster): 75% response rate - uses ALL personality types!

## 🔍 DEDUCTION STRATEGY

### Step 1: Identify Personality Type
Listen for personality-specific words across multiple questions:

- **Aggressive words** (your fear, leave now, watching you, run now) → **Wraith or Onyx**
- **Shy words** (quiet please, go away, far away, don't know) → **Banshee or Shade**
- **Chaotic words** (break things, everywhere now, echo here) → **Poltergeist or Phantom**
- **Mixed personalities** (aggressive + shy + chaotic) → **Trickster!**

### Step 2: Listen for Unique Words
Unique words (15% chance) are the strongest clues:

| Unique Word | Ghost |
|-------------|-------|
| lost soul, thin veil, drifting by | **Wraith** |
| mourning song, doorway edge, still listening | **Banshee** |
| still quiet, deep corner, watching softly | **Shade** |
| mess maker, inside walls, here-here | **Poltergeist** |
| empty echo, between worlds, fading in | **Phantom** |
| deep hunger, below earth, heavy breath | **Onyx** |
| again again, look up, behind you | **Trickster** |

### Step 3: Check Response Frequency
- **High response rate (75%)** → Wraith, Onyx, or Trickster
- **Medium response rate (55%)** → Poltergeist or Phantom
- **Low response rate (35%)** → Banshee or Shade

### Step 4: Combine with Other Tools
Spirit Box alone can't identify a ghost! Use:
- **Camera**: Check manifestation type (silhouette, blur, shadow, etc.)
- **Thermal**: Check temperature reading (normal, cold spot, deep cold)
- **EMF**: Check distance and proximity patterns

## 🎯 QUICK IDENTIFICATION FLOWCHART

```
1. Hear mixed personality words? → TRICKSTER
   ↓ No
2. Hear unique word?
   - "lost soul" / "thin veil" → WRAITH
   - "mourning song" / "doorway edge" → BANSHEE
   - "still quiet" / "deep corner" → SHADE
   - "mess maker" / "inside walls" → POLTERGEIST
   - "empty echo" / "between worlds" → PHANTOM
   - "deep hunger" / "below earth" → ONYX
   ↓ No unique word heard
3. Check personality pattern:
   - Aggressive words + high response → WRAITH or ONYX
   - Shy words + low response → BANSHEE or SHADE
   - Chaotic words + medium response → POLTERGEIST or PHANTOM
   ↓
4. Use Camera/Thermal/EMF to confirm!
```

## 💡 INVESTIGATION TIPS

### Spirit Box Usage:
- **Ask all 3 questions** - Different questions give different word pools
- **Wait 15 seconds between responses** - Spirit Box has cooldown
- **Listen for personality patterns** - One word isn't enough
- **Note unique words immediately** - They're rare (15% chance)
- **Track response frequency** - Low responses = shy ghost

### Common Mistakes:
- ❌ Relying on common words (they don't help)
- ❌ Only asking one question (need multiple contexts)
- ❌ Ignoring response frequency (it's a key clue!)
- ❌ Not using other tools (Spirit Box alone can't solve it)

### Pro Strategies:
- ✅ Ask each question 2-3 times for pattern recognition
- ✅ Combine personality words with unique words
- ✅ Use Camera to narrow down between similar ghosts
- ✅ Check Thermal reading to confirm ghost type
- ✅ Watch for Trickster's contradictory behavior

## 🎮 GAMEPLAY MECHANICS

### How Spirit Box Works in Investigation Mode:
1. **Tune the knobs** to find the ghost's frequency (random each time)
2. **Signal locks** when both knobs are within tolerance
3. **Ask a question** using one of the three buttons
4. **Ghost responds** (or shows "No response..." if it doesn't want to talk)
5. **15-second cooldown** before you can ask again
6. **New frequency** is generated after each response (must retune!)

### Evidence Tab Integration:
- Spirit Box responses are logged in the Evidence tab
- Track personality type, words heard, and response frequency
- Use evidence to narrow down possible ghosts
- Select ghost type when you have enough evidence

**Remember: No single tool can identify a ghost. Use Spirit Box + Camera + Thermal + EMF together!**

**Good luck hunting! 👻**
