# 🎯 Hackathon Demo - Quick Reference Card

## ⚠️ KEY CLARIFICATION
- ✅ **Real landmarks** from Overpass API (implemented)
- ✅ **GPS in Investigation Mode** (implemented - live tracking)
- ✅ **Compass in Investigation Mode** (implemented)
- ❌ **GPS on overworld map** (NOT implemented - uses Dev Mode)

**Focus demo on Investigation Mode for GPS features!**

## ⚡ 2-MINUTE SCRIPT (Condensed)

### [0:00-0:15] HOOK
**"What if every landmark in your neighborhood could become a haunted investigation site?"**

**"Ghost Hunt uses real-world geolocation to turn actual landmarks—parks, monuments, buildings—into paranormal hotspots. We pull live data from OpenStreetMap."**

**[SHOW MAP]**

---

### [0:15-0:30] TECHNICAL FEATURES
**"We use Overpass API to fetch real POIs within 2.5km radius. Each hotspot is a real landmark. When you enter Investigation Mode, real GPS tracking activates with Haversine calculations and your phone's compass for direction."**

**[ZOOM MAP, SHOW HOTSPOTS]**

---

### [0:30-0:45] LANDMARK DEMO
**[TAP HOTSPOT]** **"This is [LANDMARK NAME]—a real location."**

**[ENTER INVESTIGATION]** **"Now GPS tracking activates. Ghost spawns using real-world coordinates."**

---

### [0:45-0:55] COMPASS/GPS
**[RADAR]** **"Radar uses compass—rotate phone physically."**

**[EMF]** **"EMF shows GPS distance as I walk in real life."**

---

### [0:55-1:15] TOOLS
**[CAMERA]** **"Take photo, 7-second delay."**

**[SWITCH TOOLS]** **"Rapid switching: Spirit Box, Thermal, EMF."**

---

### [1:15-1:30] DEDUCTION
**[EVIDENCE TAB]** **"Overlapping clues—no single tool solves it."**

**[SELECT GHOST]** **"Poltergeist!"**

---

### [1:30-1:50] TECH STACK
**"OpenStreetMap landmarks via Overpass API, live GPS in Investigation Mode, compass integration, Haversine calculations. Built with React, TypeScript, Leaflet."**

---

### [1:50-2:00] CLOSING
**"Ghost Hunt transforms your neighborhood into a paranormal zone. Works anywhere in the world with real landmarks. Thank you!"**
