Your Ideal Hunt (summed up)

One investigation, in your head, looks like:

You enter the hotspot.

You pull out Radar:

You rotate in place IRL until the ghost blip lines up.

Radar = compass-style direction only (“it’s somewhere that way”).

You switch to EMF:

Walk forward in that direction.

EMF = distance only:

Beeps faster = you’re closing in.

Beeps slower = you’re walking away.

When EMF is screaming:

You quickly swap to Camera.

Take a picture (uses film, locks Camera for ~7 seconds while developing).

While it develops, you swap to other tools:

Thermal (cold?)

Audio (whispers?)

Maybe Static later.

You’re juggling tools under:

Time pressure (sanity ticking down + ghost maybe moving in harder mode).

Limited resources (film, potions/charms).

Between tool checks, you:

Re-check Radar: did the ghost move direction?

Re-check EMF: is it still close, or did it drift away?

When photo is ready, you open Photos, see manifestation/none.

Use the Evidence + Codex to narrow down ghost type.

Eventually:

You lock in a guess.

Clippy handles the “banish/explain what it was”.

You either feel like a genius or a clown 

Skill expression =
how fast & smart you rotate through tools and read imperfect signals under resource + sanity pressure.
