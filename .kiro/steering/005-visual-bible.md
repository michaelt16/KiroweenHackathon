## Mobile Considerations

### Touch Targets
- Minimum 44px tap area
- Generous padding
- Clear visual feedback

### Readability
- High contrast text
- Minimum 14px font size
- Avoid thin fonts on textured backgrounds

### Performance
- Optimize texture images
- Use CSS for simple effects
- Lazy load heavy assets

---

## Implementation Notes

### CSS Approach
- Use CSS for textures where possible (gradients, noise)
- SVG for tape, corners, decorative elements
- PNG for complex textures (paper, Polaroid)

### Component Structure
```
<AnalogWrapper>  ← Paper texture, tape, etc.
  <DigitalContent>  ← Functional UI
  </DigitalContent>
</AnalogWrapper>
```

### Reusable Components
- `<PaperCard>` - Paper texture container
- `<PolaroidFrame>` - Photo frame wrapper
- `<StickyNote>` - Yellow note component
- `<TapeCorner>` - Tape decoration
- `<HandwrittenText>` - Styled text component
- `<IDCard>` - Agent ID layout
