# 🎬 Ghost Hunt - Hackathon Demo Script (Under 2 Minutes)

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: What's Actually Implemented

**✅ IMPLEMENTED:**
- Real landmarks from Overpass API (on overworld map)
- GPS tracking in Investigation Mode (live updates as you walk)
- Compass integration in Investigation Mode (physical phone rotation)
- Haversine distance calculations in Investigation Mode

**❌ NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:**
- Real-time GPS tracking on overworld map (currently uses Dev Mode - tap to teleport)
- Overworld map doesn't update as you walk (only Investigation Mode has live GPS)

**📝 DEMO STRATEGY:**
- Focus on Investigation Mode for GPS/compass features (this IS implemented)
- Emphasize real landmarks from Overpass API (this IS implemented)
- Don't claim overworld map has live GPS tracking (it doesn't yet)

## 🎬 FULL SCRIPT

### [0:00-0:15] HOOK - The Geolocation Innovation
**"What if every landmark in your neighborhood could become a haunted investigation site?"**

**"Ghost Hunt uses real-world geolocation to turn actual landmarks—parks, monuments, buildings—into paranormal hotspots. We pull live data from OpenStreetMap, so wherever you are, the game finds real places to explore."**

**[SHOW MAP WITH REAL LANDMARKS]**
**"See these hotspots? They're not random—they're actual landmarks near you right now."**

---

### [0:15-0:30] LANDMARK FEATURE DEEP DIVE
**"Here's the technical magic: We use the Overpass API to fetch real Points of Interest—parks, churches, monuments, community centers—within a 2.5-kilometer radius. Just like Pokémon Go's Pokéstops, but for ghost hunting."**

**"Each hotspot is placed at a real-world landmark. When you enter Investigation Mode, the game uses live GPS tracking, calculates distances using the Haversine formula, and uses your phone's compass to determine direction."**

**[ZOOM IN ON MAP, SHOW HOTSPOTS]**
**"These aren't random spawns—they're actual locations you can visit in the real world."**

---

### [0:30-0:45] LIVE DEMO - Landmark Discovery
**[TAP ON A HOTSPOT WITH REAL LANDMARK NAME]**
**"This hotspot is at [LANDMARK NAME]—a real location. When I tap it..."**

**[ENTER INVESTIGATION MODE]**
**"...Investigation Mode activates. The ghost spawns at a random position within 50 meters of this landmark, using real-world coordinates."**

---

### [0:45-0:55] COMPASS & GPS INTEGRATION
**[SHOW RADAR TOOL]**
**"The Radar uses your phone's compass. See this blip? I need to physically rotate my phone to align with the ghost's direction."**

**[ROTATE PHONE PHYSICALLY]**
**"This isn't a virtual joystick—it's real-world movement. The EMF meter shows distance based on actual GPS calculations as I walk closer."**

---

### [0:55-1:15] INVESTIGATION TOOLS SHOWCASE
**[SWITCH TO EMF]**
**"EMF shows distance plus personality patterns. As I walk closer using real GPS..."**

**[SWITCH TO CAMERA, TAKE PHOTO]**
**"...I take a photo. But there's a 7-second film development delay—this creates real tension."**

**[RAPIDLY SWITCH: SPIRIT BOX → THERMAL → EMF]**
**"While waiting, I'm frantically switching tools—tuning the Spirit Box, checking thermal readings, re-verifying EMF. This tool-juggling window is where skill matters."**

---

### [1:15-1:30] DEDUCTION SYSTEM
**[SHOW EVIDENCE TAB]**
**"After gathering evidence, I review the clues. Each tool gives overlapping hints—no single tool solves it. Camera shows 'motion blur'—that's two ghosts. EMF shows 'unstable'—that's two more. But the overlap..."**

**[SELECT GHOST]**
**"...points to Poltergeist. This deduction system ensures you need multiple pieces of evidence, just like real detective work."**

---

### [1:30-1:50] TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS
**"What makes this special: Real-world landmark integration using OpenStreetMap's Overpass API, live GPS tracking in Investigation Mode with Haversine distance calculations, compass-based direction finding, and a skill-based deduction system with seven unique ghost types."**

**"It's built with React, TypeScript, Leaflet for mapping, and integrates with Overpass API for real-world POI data. Every investigation happens at a real location you can visit, and once you enter Investigation Mode, you use real GPS and compass to find the ghost."**

---

### [1:50-2:00] CLOSING
**"Ghost Hunt transforms your neighborhood into a paranormal investigation zone. It's location-based gaming meets skill-based deduction—and it works anywhere in the world with real landmarks."**

**"Thank you!"**

## 🚨 BACKUP PLAN (If Demo Fails - 30 seconds)

**"Ghost Hunt is an AR location-based ghost hunting game that uses real-world geolocation. We integrate with OpenStreetMap's Overpass API to fetch actual landmarks—parks, monuments, buildings—and turn them into investigation hotspots. Once you enter Investigation Mode, the game uses live GPS tracking and your phone's compass for direction finding. Players physically walk during investigations and use five tools to gather evidence. The unique mechanic is a skill-based deduction system where no single tool solves the case—you must combine overlapping clues. It's like Phasmophobia meets Pokémon Go, but with real landmarks from your neighborhood."**

## 🎙️ AI VOICEOVER SCRIPT

**Copy this section for AI voiceover tools:**

Walking through the woods now. Snow's fresh. Quiet. Too quiet.

Made it up the hill. Radar's picking up something. Strong signal.

Stopped at the old sign. Reading it. Checked the radar again—blip is getting stronger.

Spinning around, trying to find the direction. Signal's pointing north. Heading that way.

Walking deeper into the woods. Following the reading. Something feels off.

I keep looking back. Nothing there. Just trees. Just shadows. But I know something's watching.

Found it. The playground. Switched to EMF. Reading spiked immediately—EMF 5. Something's definitely here.

Temperature reading's unstable. Can't get a clear signal. Too cold maybe.

Switched to spirit box. Tuning through static. "Is anyone here?"

Something answered. A voice through the static. I jumped. Looked right. Nothing there. But it answered.

Raised the camera. Aiming through the playground bars. Flash went off.

I saw it. Between the bars. Something in the darkness. Something that shouldn't be there.

I looked directly at it. It stared back at me.

I ran.

It's chasing me. I can hear it. Footsteps. Branches snapping. It's faster than anything should be.

My foot caught on something. I fell.

The last thing I saw was it closing in.
